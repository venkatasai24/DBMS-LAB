Welcome to the NITCbase project! NITCbase is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) implementation project that is intended to help an undergraduate student understand the design and data structures of an elementary RDBMS by implementing one herself.

## Getting-Started

To use NITCbase, please follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.<pre>git clone https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB</pre>  
- Navigate to the NITCbase.<pre>cd DBMS-LAB/mynitcbase</pre>  
- Execute the necessary scripts to initialize the database.<pre>make</pre>
- Run the application to start managing academic data efficiently.<pre>./nitcbase</pre>

## Usage

NITCBase provides a simple command-line interface for executing basic database operations. You can interact with the database using various SQL commands. For detailed information on available commands and their usage, refer to the XFS-Documentation provided at [link](https://nitcbase.github.io/docs/User%20Interface%20Commands/).

## NITCBase Documentation

For detailed information on architecture, methodology, design and roadmap, please refer to the [NITCBase Documentation](https://nitcbase.github.io/).

## Project Explanation

The NITCbase project is divided into 12 stages, each representing a significant milestone in the development process. You can find detailed explanations, code, and documentation for each stage in the following links:

- [Stage 3](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage3) : The Disk Buffer and Catalog Caches
- [Stage 4](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage4) : Linear Search on Relations 
- [Stage 5](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage5) : Opening Relations 
- [Stage 6](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage6) : Buffer Management and Disk Write-back 
- [Stage 7](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage7) : Inserting Records Into Relations 
- [Stage 8](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage8) : Creating and Deleting Relations 
- [Stage 9](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage9) : Selection and Projection on Relations
- [Stage 10](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage10) : B+ Tree Search on Relations 
- [Stage 11](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage11) : Index Creation and Deletion 
- [Stage 12](https://github.com/venkatasai24/DBMS-LAB/tree/stage12) : Join on Relations
